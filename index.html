    Hello! My name is Rychard, and I am from Kampala, Uganda. I am a dedicated learner who enjoys exploring technology and
    building new skills.
    I have a strong interest in web development and programming, and I am constantly working to improve my knowledge
    through courses and personal projects.
    Outside of academics, I love listening to music as it helps me relax and stay focused, especially when I am working on
    coding assignments.
    I also enjoy watching series during my free time, which gives me a chance to unwind and discover new stories.
    Growing up in Kampala has shaped me into a hardworking and creative person who values community, faith, and kindness.
    I am passionate about building a better future for myself and using my skills to contribute positively to others.
    One of my goals is to become a skilled software developer and help create tools that make people’s lives easier.
    I believe in continuous growth and love challenging myself to learn something new every day.
    I value teamwork, honesty, and consistency, and I try to apply these principles in everything I do.
    Overall, I am someone who is committed to becoming the best version of myself.
